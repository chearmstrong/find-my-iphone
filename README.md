# Find My iPhone

Simple AWS Lambda function triggered from a custom Amazon Alexa skill (unpublished).

I did this a simple introduction to AWS Lambda.

Running `npm run build` creates a `.zip` file in `/lambda-dist` and includes the `node_modules` folder, ready for upload to AWS Lambda.

Uses the following key NPM modules:
- alexa-app - https://github.com/alexa-js/alexa-app
- find-my-iphone - https://github.com/matt-kruse/find-my-iphone
