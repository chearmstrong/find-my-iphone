# Find My iPhone

Simple AWS Lambda function triggered from my custom Amazon Alexa skill.

Will be expanding more on this soon...

Running 'npm run build' creates a .zip file in /lambda-dist and includes the node_modules folder, ready for upload to AWS Lambda.

Uses the following key NPM modules:
- alexa-app - https://github.com/alexa-js/alexa-app
- find-my-iphone - https://github.com/matt-kruse/find-my-iphone
